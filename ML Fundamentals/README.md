# Machine Learning Fundamentals

**ML Fundamentals** is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`),
which explores wide range of ML topics, from foundational Python programming 
to advanced algorithms like CNNs and boosting. 
Each notebook is designed to demonstrate key concepts, techniques, 
and practical applications in machine learning.
The [Datasets](Datasets/) directory contains all files used in the codes.



## Overview

- **Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive learning resource, covering programming basics, data analysis, supervised/unsupervised learning, and deep learning.
- **Format**: Twelve `.ipynb` files, each focusing on a distinct topic.
- **Tools**: Python and its libraries.
