# Machine Learning Fundamentals

**ML Fundamentals** explores wide range of ML topics,
from foundational Python programming to advanced algorithms like CNNs and boosting.
Each Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) file is located in its own directory. They are designed
to demonstrate key concepts, techniques, and practical applications in Machine Learning. 
Supporting files used in the codes are included within the corresponding folders when applicable.
